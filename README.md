# ligand_prediction

the methods and models displayed here can do two things: the make_predictions.py file can generate protein level ligand binding predictions for metal ions, nucleic acids, and small molecules, whilst residue_refinement.py refines previously computed residue predictions using information gained by the protein predictions

## Usage

make_predictions.py requires the following arguments: --embeddings \<protein level embedding file generated through the bio_embeddings pipeline\> --output_dir \<output directory\> --models \<filepath to the models directory\> -\<c|t|s\> 
  
residue_refinement.py requires the following arguments: --embeddings \<protein level embedding file generated through the bio_embeddings pipeline\> --output_dir \<output directory\> --models \<filepath to the models directory\> -\<c|t|s\> --residue \<directory with residue level binding prediction generated by bindEmbed21DL\>
  
## Requirements
  
all programs are written in Python3, which has to be installed locally to run.
Additionally, the following Python packages have to be installed:
- torch
- numpy
- argparse
- h5py
- os
  
## Data
Embedding files can be generated via the *bio_embeddinds* pipeline [1].
Residue predictions can be generated by *bindEmbed21DL* [2] available via <https://github.com/Rostlab/bindPredict>
